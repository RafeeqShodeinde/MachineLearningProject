# MachineLearningProject: Irish Language Modelling 
The goal of this project was to perform estimation of the probabilities of a particular set of 25 pairs of Irish words in context.

The Irish language makes use of diacritics (acute accents á, é, í, ó, ú known as síntí fada in the language) to mark long vowels, and there are many hundreds of word pairs differing only in the presence or absence of these diacritics. This competition involves predicting which of a given word pair is the correct one given the rest of the sentence as context. I have restricted to a set of 25 of the most common such pairs
